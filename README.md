# Churn Prediction Application

## Overview:
This project aims to create an application that predicts customer churn using a machine learning model. Users can input customer data, and the model will predict if the customer is likely to churn, along with a confidence factor.

## Technologies Used:
- Model Deployment: TensorFlow Serving
- Web Framework: Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Cloud Services: AWS (for model deployment)

## Functionality:
- Users can input customer data via a web interface.
- The application sends the data to the deployed model for prediction.
- The prediction (churn or not) and confidence factor are displayed on the interface.
