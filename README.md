# Churn Prediction Application

## Overview:
This project aims to create an application that predicts customer churn using a machine learning model. Users can input customer data, and the model will predict if the customer is likely to churn, along with a confidence factor.

## Technologies Used:
1. Python

    Description: Python serves as the primary programming language for the development of machine learning models, data preprocessing, and analysis.

2. Machine Learning Libraries
a. TensorFlow and Keras

    Description: TensorFlow is employed as the deep learning framework, and Keras, integrated with TensorFlow, is used to build and train neural network models.

b. Scikit-learn

    Description: Scikit-learn is utilized for various machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

3. Data Analysis and Visualization
a. Pandas

    Description: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the dataset.

b. Matplotlib and Seaborn

    Description: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization to gain insights into the dataset and the model performance.

4. Jupyter Notebooks

    Description: Jupyter Notebooks are employed for an interactive and collaborative development environment. The code for this project is organized and presented in Jupyter Notebooks to enhance readability and understanding.

5. Version Control
a. Git

    Description: Git is used for version control, enabling collaborative development and tracking changes to the codebase.

6. Documentation
a. Markdown

    Description: Markdown is used for creating documentation, including this README file, to provide an overview of the project and guide users on how to explore and use the code.
   
7. Web Framework: Flask
8. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Functionality:
- Users can input customer data via a web interface.
- The application sends the data to the deployed model for prediction.
- The prediction (churn or not) and confidence factor are displayed on the interface.
